			<h2>Planting trees</h2>
			<p>
				The movement's initiatives include tree planting campaigns, waste management 
				programs, and the promotion of renewable energy sources with recent initiatives being engaging in tree planting exercises and so far 500,000 seedlings have been planted. Since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sunâ€™s heat and raising temperatures. 
				The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining bio diversity
